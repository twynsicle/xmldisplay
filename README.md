##### Purpose
When debugging websites built using XSLT, it can be useful to output the XML into the page to assist in debugging. This extension makes it easier to check the XML used in the transform, without needing to export to another application just to view with formatting and syntax highlighting.

##### Features
- XML displays in collapsible list.
- Can be configured to automatically collapse elements after a set depth, or to collapse elements based on their names.
- Nests the output inside the Shadow DOM to isolate it from styling in the host page.
